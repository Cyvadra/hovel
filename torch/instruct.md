Design a DNN with pytorch to train model with given dataset and predict Y series.

1. Model size shall be extremely small, since we don't have many samples.
2. Use a tiny learning rate, and use advanced training methods.
3. Support training on multiple gpus. (assume 4 cards)
4. `swish` is suggested in activation functions.
5. Take caution not to overfit.
6. After model trained, plot validation set Y and prediction series Y, save figures.
